## Meaningful movies

The purpose of this post is to note inspirational quotes from movies, some lessons that can be applied to real-life situations, just to make sure that I do not forget why I liked the movie in the first instance.


### 1. Into the wild
>
> "There is pleasure in the pathless woods.  
> There is rapture on the lonely shore.  
> There is society, where no one intrudes.  
> By the deep sea, and the music in its roar.  
> I love not man the less, but Nature more."  -  Lord Byron  


### 2. The Departed
> I don’t want to be a product of my environment. I want my environment to be a product of me.

While still on crutches, I rewatched one of my favorite movies, **"The Departed"**, with this line starting the movie which is said by Jack Nicholson. This line reflects the power that an individual can have, to change the environment around him (definitely can be applied in engineering departments).
