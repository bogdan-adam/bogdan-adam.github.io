## Meaningful movies

The purpose of this post is to note inspirational quotes from movies, some lessons that can be applied to real-life situations, just to make sure that I do not forget why I liked the movie in the first instance.


### 1. Into the wild
>
> "There is pleasure in the pathless woods.  
> There is rapture on the lonely shore.  
> There is society, where no one intrudes.  
> By the deep sea, and the music in its roar.  
> I love not man the less, but Nature more."  -  George Gordon Byron

With this sublime [poem](https://poets.org/anthology/byron-1) by *George Gordon Byron* starts this movie. **Into the wild** for sure it's in my top five favorite movies of all time. This poem awakens a desire in me, to travel more, to go hiking, to spend more time alone in nature ... 

> "Some people feel like they don’t deserve love. They walk away quietly into empty spaces, trying to close the gaps of the past."


> "When you want something in life, you just gotta reach out and grab it."

Even if this is just a quote from a movie, it can be easily extrapolated to the corporate environment, having control and ownership of what we are doing. According to science, people who set goals that are both specific and challenging, are 90% more likely to achieve what they've set their mind to.

> "The core of mans’ spirit comes from new experiences."

Best advice: appreciate nature and live life as a free spirit.

> "Happiness is only real when shared."

The act of sharing happiness is a true joy for one's soul...

### 2. The Departed
> "I don’t want to be a product of my environment. I want my environment to be a product of me."

While still on crutches, I rewatched one of my favorite movies, **"The Departed"**, with this line starting the movie which is said by Jack Nicholson. This line reflects the power that an individual can have, to change the environment around him (definitely can be applied in engineering departments).

### To be added ...
> This post will be work-in-progress, as there are many great movies that I saw or I will watch!
