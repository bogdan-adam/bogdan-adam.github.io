### Why Model-Based Testing ?
I have heard of model-based testing but never applied it in a real project, not even in a proof-of-concept. The purpose of this post is to document what I find useful about Model-Based Testing and do a PoC using existing open-source projects. When I will have the chance to use it on a real project the content of this post and gained knowledge will allow me to come up faster with a solution.
